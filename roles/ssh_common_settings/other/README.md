Variables set in one role are available to later roles. You can set variables in the roleâ€™s vars directory (as defined in Role directory structure) and use them in other roles and elsewhere in your playbook:

roles:
   - role: common_settings
   - role: something
     vars:
       foo: 12
   - role: something_else
